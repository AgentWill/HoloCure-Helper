# HoloCure-Helper
 Tool I made to help with creating builds during runs of HoloCure.

# Help
All commands to do anything at any point are shown in the console, except for the fact that you can use R to reset at any time other than choosing a character, not just when it asks about resetting.

It will show a few different things after weapons or collabs at times.
 - Favored means the character you chose buffs the weapon or collab specifically
 - Not in a build means the weapon or collab does not appear in any full build with the maximum amount of available collabs
 - Collab (on weapons) means that the weapon in question can complete a collab with another chosen weapon
 - Build Collab is an extension of the previous case, since the same is true except the collab is also in a build, as described above

# Plans
I currently have a few plans regarding where to go with this project.

The 2 that are almost guaranteed are the following
 - GUI for the app rather than just using command line input and output
 - Allowing users to select what weapons and collabs can appear as options in the program

Meanwhile, 2 other potential goals that I have not decided for sure that I implement
 - Add items into the program, keeping track of what items the player has chosen and allowing for items to be set as favored on certain characters
 - Keep track of scores obtained with each character and using those scores to influence the order in which weapon, collab (and item) suggestions appear based on how much they hurt or helped your score compared to previous runs

The second one especially would be a large undertaking that I'm not entirely sure how to implement yet, so I'm not sure it will happen.
